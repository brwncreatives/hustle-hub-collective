            We spend so much of our time working for others—our jobs, our families, our responsibilities—but what about our dreams? 
            Hustle Saturday is about reclaiming your time to pour into yourself and your goals. It's a day dedicated to side hustles, 
            personal growth, and turning aspirations into action—all with the support of your own online community.

            Hustle Saturday began as a simple idea: a Saturday morning meetup where we'd spend 1-3 hours working on the things we kept putting off. 
            It was a time to focus, support each other, and make real progress.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-muted-foreground">
            As life got busier, we realized we needed a tool to keep the momentum going, even when we couldn't always meet face-to-face. 
            That's how this platform was born—a way to streamline our sessions, hold each other accountable, and stay connected to our goals.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-muted-foreground">
            Now, whether you want to create your own Hustle Saturday group or join an existing community, this tool is here to help you stay focused, 
            inspired, and on track.
